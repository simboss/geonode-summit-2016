GeoNode relies on [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) by default for some of its core functionalities related to serving geospatial data.
This presentation will provide an introduction to the GeoServer project and its abilities to publish data with a mix of well known OGC protocols and other popular protocol and data formats, like:

* Setting up vector and raster data from the GeoServer administration control
* Styling layers using desktop tools, with a carousel of GeoServer mapping abilities
* Tile caching with WMTS 

but it will also go beyond that, introducing advanced capabilities like

* Data processing with WPS
* Security
* Spatiotemporal data handling
